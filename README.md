# Project 1, ENGI 301, Vanessa Garlepp
This project is the development code for an LED-based maze game. An accelerometer will detect movement, and compare this movement to thresholds to determine in which direction the pixel will move. This repository contains preliminary codes which use a random number generator to move the pixel throughout the maze in a series of images. This code can later be easily adapted to take in data from the accelerometer and output movement to the LED matrix.
